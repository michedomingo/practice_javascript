# Grid

Challenge:

- Practice playing with event listeners
  - Use an event listener and CSS either inline or through an added class to draw a highlight around the entire grid when you hover over it with your mouse.
  - Add an event listener to each grid cell to highlight that cell when you hover your mouse over it.
  - Add an event listener to each grid cell to change its background color when it is clicked.
  - Add an event listener to a specific key on the keyboard to change the background color of the whole page - from dark to light and back again.
